# DataFu Pig

Apache DataFu Pig is a collection of user-defined functions for working with large scale data in [Apache Pig](http://pig.apache.org/).  It has a number of useful functions available:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <h4>Statistics</h4>
    <p>
      Compute quantiles, median, variance, wilson binary confidence, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Set Operations</h4>
    <p>
      Perform set intersection, union, or difference of bags.
    </p>

    <h4>Bags</h4>
    <p>
      Convenient functions for working with bags such as enumerate items,
      append, prepend, concat, group, distinct, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Sessions</h4>
    <p>
      Sessionize events from a stream of data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <h4>Estimation</h4>
    <p>
      Streaming implementations that can estimate
      quantiles and median.
    </p>

    <h4>Sampling</h4>
    <p>
      Simple random sampling with or without replacement,
      weighted sampling.
    </p>

    <h4>Link Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Run PageRank on a graph represented by a bag of
      nodes and edges.
    </p>

    <h4>More</h4>
    <p>
      Other useful methods like Assert and Coalesce.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

If you'd like to read more details about these functions, check out the [Guide](/docs/datafu/guide.html).  Otherwise if you are
ready to get started using DataFu Pig, keep reading.

The rest of this page assumes you already have a built JAR available.  If this is not the case, please see the [Download](/docs/download.html) page.

## Basic Example: Computing Median

Let's use DataFu Pig to perform a very basic task: computing the median of some data.
Suppose we have a file `input` in Hadoop with the following content:

    1
    2
    3
    2
    2
    2
    3
    2
    2
    1

We can clearly see that the median is 2 for this data set.  First we'll start up Pig's grunt shell by running `pig` and
then register the DataFu JAR:

```pig
register datafu-pig-<%= current_page.data.version %>.jar
```

To compute the median we'll use DataFu's `StreamingMedian`, which computes an estimate of the median but has the benefit
of not requiring the data to be sorted:

```pig
DEFINE Median datafu.pig.stats.StreamingMedian();
```

Next we can load the data and pass it into the function to compute the median:

```pig
data = LOAD 'input' using PigStorage() as (val:int);
data = FOREACH (GROUP data ALL) GENERATE Median(data);
DUMP data
```

This produces the expected output:

    ((2.0))
